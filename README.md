# BarTabBilly

This a little demo project to show the lovely people at Betway Africa that I can actually code (on a good day). This is the main readme document with the highlights - but links to the more detail readme are provided where relevant. These readmes are written on the premise the reader doesn't know too much.

## Project requirements

Those requirements are set out in the [Project requirements readme](sub-readmes/project-requirements.md)

## Stack

Typically I work with a MEAN stack but I like using Firebase for personal projects. Also the project is so small may not even need to use a service side component so that would potentially make this a JAMstack

### JavaScript: Angular

You can view the [standard Angular readme](sub-readmes/angular.md), but basically all you really need to know is to serve the project run commands

- `npm i` (for first time serves - but not a bad idea to do often-ish)
- `ng serve`

and the project should serve on `http://localhost:4200`

### API: Firebase

There isn't a read me for Firebase per se but you can always checkout there [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs)
