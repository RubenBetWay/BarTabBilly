# BarTabBilly

This a little demo project to show the lovely people at Betway Africa that I can actually code (on a good day). This is the main readme document with the highlights - but links to the more detail readme are provided where relevant

## Stack

Typically I work with a MEAN stack but I like using Firebase for personal projects. Also the project is so small may not even need to use a service side component so that would potentially make this a JAMstack

### JavaScript: Angular

You can view the [standard Angular readme](./dubn-readmes/angular.md)
