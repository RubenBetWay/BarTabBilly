# Project Requirements

Build a open bar tap web app in your preferred frontend framework. The web app should be as slim as possible, but cover the list [user stories](#user-stories-to-be-met) and use the [required data](#data-to-use)

## User Stories to be met

1. As a user I want a view that lists 3 different kinds of beverages.
2. As a user I should be be able to enter how many of each type of beverage I want for a “round of drinks”.
3. As a user I should be able to submit/add the specified order or beverages to my open tab.
4. As a user I want to, optionally, enter how many people will split the total bill.
5. As a user I want to, at any time, be able to request the total of my bill - including a price per. person, if applicable.
6. As a user I would like to be able to export the tab as a CSV or PDF to give to the customer as a receipt.

## Data to use

Beers on tap
|Beverage|Price (ZAR)|

<h6>These must be Sandton prices - what a rip</h6>
